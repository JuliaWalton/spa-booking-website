## Overview

## The goal

The intention behind the build for Spa Selene was to apply front end patterns and implement them together to form a full site. This process allowed me to increase my capabilities and confidence problem solving with JavaScript while continuing to grow my familiarity with using SASS. Due to the nature of the buisness the website was chosen to reflex, there were some essential components that should to be incorported. First, a website that offers a menu of services such as a spa needs to fetch, filter, and display related content by category. Also, a form validation component would be necessary to facilitate the exchange of customer information to reserve a service. In my mind, these two concepts formed the primary development features for the site with more general components like an about section, a frequently asked questions section, and a reviews section emplyed to add legitamecy and well rounded aspects to better inform the site's purpose to users.

Your users should be able to:

- experience a responsive and fixed navigation
- display a category of data in response to a click event
- utilize a form component to input all booking information
- view custom form validation responses to inputs
- cycle through an image carousel
- toggle an accordion component
- cycle through a list of reviews
- explore the various tabs of the site through button clicks and the nav bar
- utilize the form component as a modal and via the home page
